You are seeing this message because the current operation invoked the \"ngcc\" command directly. This \"ngcc\" invocation can be safely removed.\n\nA common reason for this is invoking \"ngcc\" from a \"postinstall\" hook in package.json.\n\nIn Angular 17, this command will be removed. Remove this and any other invocations to prevent errors in later versions.\n\n==========================================\n\n";
